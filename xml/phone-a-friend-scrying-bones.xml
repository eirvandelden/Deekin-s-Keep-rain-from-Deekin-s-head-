    <text>There are three bones carved into people with happy faces and sad faces. All happy faces means yes, all sad faces mean no, anything in between means maybe.</text>
    <text />
    <text>These bones can be used to ask a "yes", "no", or "maybe" question to the fates (DM).</text>
    <text />
    <text>The DM can respond or choose not to answer.</text>
    <text/>
    <text>Each bone contains one charge. Comes in a set of three.</text>
