# Deekin's "Keep rain from Deekins's head"

After an hour-long search, you have arrived at the store you were looking for.
There is a faded sign hanging above the door that says "Deekins 'keep rain from DEEKINs head'".
The shop is filled with boxes, chests and random adventuring gear. When you enter through the door, you hear a small bell tinkel, then fall on your head.

A small Kobold pops his head up from behind the Desk, saying "Deekin? Oh, a customer welcome!".
Is this the merchant you have traveled half a globe for? Well he have the item you have been desperately seeking?

This app is made for me as a DM to host a website where my players can find new items they want to purchase.
Most of my players use the Fight Club app from Lion's den, so it allows an XML file to be downloaded for each magic item.
